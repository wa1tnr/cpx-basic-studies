Circuit Playground Express (the CPX) - basic studies in Circuit Python

Much of this repository comes from direct copies (perhaps modified, later)
of code published by Adafruit Industries.  Most of their CircuitPython stuff
appears to be MIT-licenced.

Any errors are apt to be my own.  Source URI's are generally provided
(though not in every instance). Where found, refer to source URI for
further information.
